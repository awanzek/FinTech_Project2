### Covid-19 Market Influence and Trade Signals
This project will incorporate an algorithmic trading bot to produce a buy low sell high strategy on the S&P500 and natural language processing to investegate sentiment of the news on Covid-19.
The end goal is to have a live dashboard where real time price of the market can be viewed on a stream compiled with trade signals for entry and exit points determined by the algorithm. Additionally, the dashboard will show the current sentiment regarding the Covid-19 crisis. This way trades can be made and the influence of Covid-19 on market prices can either be valid or non-existent.

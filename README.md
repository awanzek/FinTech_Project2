This project will incorporate an algorithmic trading bot to produce a buy low sell high strategy on the S&P500. The trading strategy will have severl features: Exponential Moving Averages, Bolinger Bands, Covid-19 Case Count Data and Natural Language Processing to investegate sentiment of the news on Covid-19.
The end goal is to have a live dashboard where real time price of the market can be viewed on a stream compiled with trade signals for entry and exit points determined by the algorithm. This way trades can be made based on both statistics and fundamental data, as well as the influence of Covid-19 on market prices.
